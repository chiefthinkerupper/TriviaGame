# TriviaGame

### Overview

In this assignment, I've created a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. I've made sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.

### Option One: Basic Quiz (Timed Form)

* I've created a trivia form with multiple choice options.

* The player has a limited amount of time (60 seconds) to finish the quiz. 

* The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that the player answer correctly and incorrectly.

* The player can pick no more than one answer per question.
